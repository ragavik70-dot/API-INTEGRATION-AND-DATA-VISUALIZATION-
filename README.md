API Integration and Data Visualization Using Python

API integration and data visualization play a crucial role in modern software and data-driven applications. This task focuses on fetching data from an external source and presenting it in a visual format that is easy to understand and analyze. In this project, Python is used as the primary programming language due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong support for data analysis and visualization.

The objective of this task is to demonstrate how Python can be used to integrate data from a public API and visualize the obtained data using popular visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. Weather data is chosen as the use case because it is a real-world example that helps in understanding trends and patterns effectively. Although real-time APIs like OpenWeatherMap can be used, sample data representing an API response is also sufficient to demonstrate the concept clearly.

The implementation begins by importing the required Python library, Matplotlib, which is widely used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. The weather data, such as days of the week and corresponding temperature values, is stored in lists. These values represent the temperature readings that would typically be retrieved from an external weather API in JSON format.
